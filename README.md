# Link Tank

Link Tank: a UX-first approach to bookmark archiving.

## Why?

Because managing bookmarks in a web browser can be a real pain:

- Who even wants to go in there? It's a tedious exercise.
- Bookmarked pages are often no longer available.
- Different browsers don't sync to each other.
- We should not have to trust Google/Microsoft/etc with our data.
- It should be EASY to find and share previously saved links.
- Existing solutions are themselves tedious.

## Status

Just tinkering with different ideas, environment, workflow right now.

:white_check_mark: reproducible environment: Docker, Laravel, Livewire, Flux, Tailwind

:white_check_mark: deployment: currently testing [Fly.io](https://fly.io) & [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com/)

:white_check_mark: functionality: display, add, edit, delete, undo

:white_large_square: layout, design

:white_large_square: onboarding, registration

:white_large_square: archiving: send to archive.org, archive.md

:white_large_square: mostly everything
